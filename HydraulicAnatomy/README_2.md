# HydraulicAnatomy procedure

## How to 

- 1) use script AnaProc.r to generate anatomies
- 2) Use MechaProc.r to estimate kr from the generated anatomies.
- 3) Use HydroAnat to analyse the data and train models that could bypass the GRANAR-MECHA part.


The Sum_up_03 excel files contains most anatomical data that we could find in the literature (2020).
We added our data from a pot experiment in www/sct_B73.csv
