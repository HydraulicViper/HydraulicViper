## For hydraulic Viper

The only purpose of CplantBox in Hydraulic Viper was to create multiple root system structure. CplantBox is however capable of doing much more. Please use the link https://github.com/Plant-Root-Soil-Interactions-Modelling/CPlantBox for more details.

## build locally

 Run CMake which configures the CPlantBox libraries by 
```bash
cmake . && make
```
in the root folder, and run some Python tutorial examples (see tutorial/latex/PlantBox_RootSytem), e.g
```bash
cd tutorial/examples/python
python3 B73script.py
```
